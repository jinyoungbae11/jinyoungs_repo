A mini game added on to a build your own world project in CS61B

Game Description: a game where you control you avatar to find the door located somewhere randomly in the map.
However, each move leaves behind a trail and you only have a certain view circle of light that shrinks every time
you reach the next stage. You also get torches to light up the map, but be careful! You might accidentally block off your own
path!
